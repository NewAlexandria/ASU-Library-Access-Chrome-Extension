# ASU Library Journal Easy-Access

     opus lucidum non ita lucernae

An incredibly simple Chrome extension that redirects you to ASU's library proxy access for the journal article you're currently viewing.

Will intelligently not redirect if you're already viewing through the library proxy.

# Roadmap

More intelligent handling of auto-redirect, etc, will be done through a fork or pull against [WUSTL's libarary access extension](https://github.com/semenko/washu-library-proxy-chrome-extension).  Theirs is not modular to any library, but it is a robust strategy that is worth generalizing.
